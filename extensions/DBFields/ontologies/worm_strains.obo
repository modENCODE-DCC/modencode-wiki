def: dhIs59[Topo::daf-9::GFP + lin-15(+)].  Expressed in a ventral pair of bilateral neurons identified as the IL1Vs or URAVs in the anterior ganglia; perinuclear.  By mid-L2, expression in the cytoplasm of the hypodermis, the syncitial epidermis, but absent from midline, epidermal seam cells.  Levels peak around the L2 molt and diminish during L4.  In some cases, transient expression seen in the L3 vulval blast cells.  Also expressed within the hermaphrodite spermatheca starting in late L4 larvae and continuing eve in old adults.  In males, expression in IL1V/URAVs and hypodermis but not somatic gonad.  In dauer larvae, strong expression in IL1V/URAv and specifically extends into axonal but not dendritic processes.  In post-dauer stages, expression in a pattern similar to reproductively growing animals, except expression is absent in the hypodermis.  Grow at 20C.  May still contain lin-15(n765) mutation in the background.

def: dhEx343[lin-15(+) + L3781::din1pdin-1E::GFP].  din-1S::GFP is detected in hypodermis, seam, intestine, and somatic gonad including the distal tip cells.  din-1S is also expressed in neurons, vulval precursors, body wall muscle, pharynx, and all tissues with heterochronic phenotypes or remodeled during dauer.  Expression is first detected in a few nuclei by the comma stage of embryogenesis.  By hatching, din-1S was widely expressed, albeit weakly. Overall expression in most tissues is detected at various levels into adult and in dauer larvae.  Animals with the array are GFP+ and non-Muv.  Animals which have lost the array are Muv and GFP-.

Segrgnt I. 10 ng/ul M01E11 + 90 ng/ul pCes1943[rol-6(su1006dm)] injected into hermaphrodite from BC842 (N2 male strain). pCes1943 carries rol-6(su1006) [an EcoRI insert from pRF4] and a kanamycin cassette.  Select Rollers to maintain. Presence of cosmid confirmed by PCR.  This transgenic strains were constructed in collaboration with the C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium Labs in St. Louis, MO and Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.  Funding for the creation of this transgenic strain was provided by a grant to Ann Rose and David Baillie from the Canadian Genome Analysis and Technology Program (CGAT), and from a grant from NSERC (Canada) to David Baillie.

def: A 1.2 kb deletion in aff-1 (C44B7.3) which introduce stop codon after alanine 47.  AFF-1 is a type I membrane protein necessary and sufficient for specific cell fusion events during embryonic and larval development. Temperature sensitivity was not detected.  At 20 the fusion of hyp5 in the embryo does not occur as well as anchor cell (AC) fusion, vulval cells fusion of the A and D rings and the terminal fusion between the seam cells late in L4.  6% L1 rod-like lethal and 0% embryonic lethal.  Adults are completely Egl, and partially Unc, Pvl.  In addition, only 2% of AC in the mutant worms undergo fusion.  These animals give very low brood size (16 progeny per worm) and 3.4% of the worms are sterile.  This strain gives very small brood size  and hence grows slowly.

def: egIs1[Pdat-1::GFP]  Bright GFP observable in dopamine neuronal soma and processes.  For some reason this strain is resistant to neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA compared to an independent strain BY200 (Nass et al., 2002).  Or maybe BY200 is sensitive more to 6-OHDA due to its co-injection marker gene rol-6?

The source of the cDNA is Yuji Kohara's clone yk240h12.  pGC8 was constructed by inserting the 1.65kb KpnI/SacI fragment of the him-14 cDNA (from base pair 1071 to 192 base pairs beyond the stop codon) into the same sites in L4440. HT115(DE3) carrying pGC8 should be selected in the presence of 50 um/ml tetracyline and 100 um/ml ampicillin.  Prior to an actual feeding experiment, it can be grown in liquid in the presence of amp alone (no tet) and then seeded onto NGM plates containing amp and 1 mM IPTG.  This technique does not work well if the cells are old; therefore, the strain should be seeded onto IPTG-containing plates from a fresh overnight that was grown from a colony on an amp/tet plate.

def: Short.  Relatively constant motion (coordinated hyperactivity).  Adults quickly become Egl-d and most have vulval bump.  Hypersensitive to stimuli.  Loopy backing, but does not like to back, especially after repeated stimuli.  Terminal phenotype is usually bag of worms. Population tends to severely crash after 2-3 weeks of starvation.  Dominant, gain-of-function allele. Heterozygotes are also hyperactive and difficult to tell

def: Adults generally short, although some can reach near normal length.  Slow growth rate.  Backing can be loopy, but does not like to back.  Strongly hypersensitive to stimuli. Relatively constant spontaneous movement.  Some clustering especially in response to stimuli.  Mature adults have vulval bump.  Most young adults are Egl-c and young embryos can be found on the plate.  Some mature adults become moderately Egl-d.  Recessive allele.  Males are small and slow growing.  Mutation is R92C, which is a conserved residue in the 10 amino acid inhibitory domain that normally functions to keep protein kinase A turned off in the absence of cAMP.  Population tends to severely crash within 2-3 weeks of starvation.

def: Hyperactive locomotion and hypersensitive to stimuli such as plate dropping.  Restores wild type levels of locomotion to paralyzed ric-8(md303) mutants.  Most, but not all adults, appear significantly Egl-c.  Some mature adults are thinner than normal.  Aldicarb sensitivity, growth rate, pumping, length, and distribution on food are all similar to wild type.  The ce268 mutation is a D448N change relative to PDE-4D isoform.  It disrupts the catalytic domain by changing one of the four active site residues that together chelate an active site zinc atom. Inheritance is semi-dominant due to dominant negative side effects.

At the non-permissive temperature DNA replication continues in the absence of mitosis.  Mutants enter mitosis at the normal time and form bipolar spindles, but fail chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate, sister chromatid separation and cytokinesis.  Molecular lesion is a 9 bp duplication followed by a T to C transversion.  Mutagen was EMS but mutation likely caused by polymerase slippage.

def: Healthy and fertile in standard lab conditions, but unable to adapt to 1% oxygen.  When hif-1(+) animals are incubated in1% oxygen, >94% will complete embryogenesis and larval development.  In contrast, hif-1(ia4) mutants exhibit 66% embryonic lethality and 9% larval lethality in 1% oxygen. The requirement of hif-1 is alleviated if the oxygen level is increased to 2%.  The ia4 mutation is a 1231 bp deletion of the second, third, and fourth exons, which encode much of the helix-loop-helix and PAS domains.  Analysis of ESTs suggests that there are at least 4 alternatively spliced hif-1 transcripts.  The ia4 deletion introduces a frameshift and a premature stop in the three longest forms.
