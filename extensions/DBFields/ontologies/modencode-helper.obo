Following first strand cDNA synthesis, the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is used to add a homopolymeric tail (i.e. a string of identical nucleotides) to the 3' end of the cDNA. A PCR reaction is then carried out, which uses a second anti-sense gene specific primer (GSP2) that binds to the known sequence, and a sense (forward) general universal primer (UP) that binds the homopolymeric tail added to the 3' ends of the cDNAs, to amplify a cDNA product from the 5' end."
